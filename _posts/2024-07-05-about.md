As everyone these days, I watch and read a lot of stuff online, on different topics.
When I find something interesting I'd like to focus and deep dive into it, until I don't feel it anymore and change topic. 

Over the years this happened for:
- Cybersecurity
- Home domotics
- Personal Finance
- Personal Growth (wellbeing)
- Calisthenics
- MTBs and biking in general

Sometimes I spend hours for nothing, other times my life changes.

Here I'd like to share what I learned, what I do and my experiences.
