Working in a cybersecurity company usually means helping big companies to mitigate risk, by implementing technology and (or) processes.

But what it is like to do that for an individual?

For sure the budget is limited here, but it really doesn't matter as usually it's not an expensive technology problem, but something more like to awareness and good practices.

First of all, it's important to understand where I can be vulnerable, and define the attack surface (or perimeter, whatever you want to name it).
This means basically everything that is directly **exposed** on the Internet:
- home network (and maybe services)
- my online accounts
and everything that can **access** it:
- my assets (mobile, laptop, tv, domotics...)
