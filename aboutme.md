Working in cybersecurity as **SIEM & SOAR guy**.

Basically I like to play with anything that can be somehow automated.

I created this blog to share ideas and my own experiences on various topics I found myself exploring over the years, related (or not) to "tech" world.

As known, sharing is (should be) caring!
